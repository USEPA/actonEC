This repository contains all the material needed to reproduce the raw data processing, including the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) gap-filling, presented in Waldo et al (sibmitted). Scripts should be run in the order detailed in masterScript.R, after editing your "projectWD" path to match your project directory. See masterLibrary.R for the version of R and associated packages used for the manuscript.

Be aware that the ANN calculations can take a long time to run.
